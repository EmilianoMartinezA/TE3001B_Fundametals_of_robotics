Implementation through
<strong>Python 3.7</strong>, using libraries such as sympy and math, for the creation of the matrices and their operations with respect to the necessary functions and data. Thus obtaining the homogeneous matrix transform.

It is necessary to calculate each element of the robot when the value of the joints changes. In this case two joints are taken into account and solved by **Denavit-Hartenberg** notation.

For the Forward kinematics case, we are given a configuration of joints to find the position or the orientation that we want to give to the robot, while in the inverse kinematics we have to find the configuration of the joints necessary for a given position/orientation of a certain part of the robot.
